# A PyBossa command line tool for Raspberry PI camera

This command line tool allows you to use a Raspberry PI camera in a 
citizen science project without having to hack or code anything.

The camera can be configured via Rasberry tools, and then all you
have to do is to set a cron job to take pictures at regular times
(i.e. every 10 minutes) to capture an image, upload it to Flickr, and
create a PyBossa task.

The goal is to analyze with the crowd the images that are being captured
by your camera almost in real time, as as soon as the images are captured
they are uploaded and shared via a PyBossa server.

## Install
